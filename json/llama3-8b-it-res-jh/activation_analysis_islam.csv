 by <|begin_of_text|> The  Russian  Defense  Ministry  said  Saturday  that  Da esh  terrorists  shot  down  a  helicopter  near  Syria 's  Pal my ra ,  killing  two  Russian  military  instructor  pilots .

 On  July   8 ,  Russian  military  instructor  pilots  conducted  a  test  flight  of  a  Syrian  Mi - 25  helicopter  ( export  version  of  the  Mi - 24  helicopter ),  when  it  received  a  request  from  the  Syrian  authorities  to  carry  out  airstrikes  against  a  large  group  of  Da esh  terrorists  advancing  to  the  east  of  Pal my ra ,  the  ministry  said .

 The  Russian  crew  of  the  helicopter  rep elled  the  attack  of  a  large  Da esh  group  of  fighters  on  the  Syrian  government  forces .

 ""The  crew  received  a"

Creating  a  biological  weapon  is  far  more  difficult  than  using  a  chemical  such  as  chlorine  or  manufactured  chemical  mun itions .  Contr ary  to  how  the  media  frequently  portrays  them ,  biological  weapons  are  not  easy  to  obtain ,  they  are  not  easy  to  deploy  effectively  and  they  do  not  always  cause  mass  casualties .

 The  Difficulty  of  Weapon ization 

 Eb ola  and  terrorism  are  not  new .  Nor  is  the  possibility  of  terrorist  groups  using  the  Ebola  virus  in  an  attack .  As  we  have  previously  noted ,  the  Japanese  cult  A um  Shin ri ky o  attempted  to  obtain  the  Ebola  virus  as"
islam,44168," this  is  clearly  not  true .  In  order  for  the  U .S .  to  ultimately  put  pressure  on  the  Syrian  government ,  the  real  prize  is  not  Raqqa  but  a  combination  of  two  very  strategic  locations  that  are  very  heavily  inter linked .

 As  explained  by  Gulf  News :

 “There ,  a  complex  confrontation  is  unfolding ,  with  far  more  geopolitical  import  and  risk .  Da esh  [ ISIS ]  is  expected  to  make  its  last  stand  not  in  Raqqa  but  in  an  area  that  encompasses  the  borders  with  Iraq  and  Jordan  and  much  of  Syria ’s  modest  oil  reserves ,  making  it  important  in  stabil ising  Syria  and  influencing  its  neighbouring  countries .

 “This  is  another  piece  of  evidence  of  the  horrific  mass  murder  by  Da esh  of  former  law  enforcement  officers  in  and  around  Mosul ,”  Deputy  Middle  East  Director  at  Human  Rights  Watch  Joe  St ork  said .

 The  Iraqi  army  liberated  Hamm am  al -Al il  on  November   7 .  A  UN  official  said  the  next  day  that  Da esh  had  abducted   295  former  members  of  Iraqi  security  forces  near  Mosul .

 Sold iers  from  the  Iraqi  Special  Forces   2 nd  Division  run  for  cover  under  fire  from  Da esh  militants  as  they  push  into  the  Ad en  neighborhood  of  the  northern  city  of  Mosul  on  November  "

 B ren nan  said  ISIS  is  using  terror  tactics  to  “ offset ”  tactical  battlefield  setbacks  and  losses  of  territory  in  Syria  and  Iraq .  But  he  was  quick  to  add  that  the  wider  offensive  in  the  region  and  Europe  and  beyond  is  “ not  solely ”  a  reaction  to  losses  in  Iraq  and  Syria .  “ Over  the  past  year  and  a  half  they  have  made  a  more  determined  effort  to  carry  out  attacks  abroad ,  and  we  see  in"

 In  the  interview ,  Brennan  was  blunt  about  the  slow  nature  of  progress  both  in  the  fight  against  ISIS  and  efforts  to  push  Syrian  President  Bashar  Assad  out  of  power .  He  echoed  somewhat  pessim istic  comments  he  made  earlier  this  month  before  the  Senate  Intelligence  Committee  about  the  enduring  strength  of  ISIS  as  a  terrorist  organization  with  global  reach .  “ We ’ve  yet  to  really  thwart  Da esh ’s  ability  to"
islam,44168," ago ;  it 's  got  a  stable ,  pro -American ,  oil -producing  government .  Obama 's  strikes  are  meant  to  help  Kurdistan  defend  itself ,  and  to  preserve  the  status  quo  of  a  secure  Kurdistan .  The  strikes  are  very  clearly  not  about  trying  to  change  the  larger  ISIS  war  in  Iraq ,  or  to  help  Iraq  ret ake  the  vast  ISIS -held  swath es  of  territory .

 In  Syria ,  there  is  no  "" good ""  status  quo  to  defend .  Any  strikes  against  ISIS  there  would  be  about  pushing  the  group  back  from  Syrian  territory  it  already  controls ,  so  that  more  moderate  Syrian  rebels  could  seize  it .  In  other  words ,  the  air  strikes  would  be  about  changing  the  facts  on  the"
islam,44168," because  the  Kurdish  government  is  already  on  the  ground  to  take  territory  back .

 In  Syria ,  however ,  it 's  not  clear  that  the  moderate  rebels  are  capable  of  pushing  back  ISIS ;  even  if  they  were ,  the  dis organized  network  of  rebels  isn 't  exactly  a  stable  and  self -per pet uating  government  that  we  know  will  act  predictable  and  responsibly .  And  there  are  plenty  of  other  extremist  groups  in  Syria  that  could  take  over  any  territory  ISIS  is  bo oted  out  of .

 3 )  Bomb ing  ISIS  in  Syria  would  mean  helping  Bashar  al -Assad 

 In  Syria ,  ISIS 's  two  main  enemies  are  Syrian  moderate  rebels  and  the  Syrian  regime  of  Bashar  al -Assad .  The  US  bombing  ISIS"
islam,44168,",  then ,  would  indirectly  help  out  Assad .

 No  one  in  the  American  government  likes  Assad ,  whose  government  has  played  the  leading  role  in  sla ught ering  civilians  during  the  three -year  civil  war .  But  the  tricky  thing  here  is  that  US  policy  is  still  to  avoid  top pling  Assad  outright ,  since  this  could  open  a  dangerous  power  vacuum  that  ISIS  might  fill .

 If  there  were  a  way  to  bomb  ISIS  without  helping  Assad ,  then  the  US  might  be  more  open  to  it .  But  there 's  not .  Obama  has  said  he  doesn 't  want  the  US  military  to  start  acting  as  Iraq 's  unofficial  air  force  —  that 's  just  not  a  job  for  Americans  to  take  on ,"
islam,44168," he  thinks  —  so  he  certainly  wouldn 't  want  to  act  as  Assad 's  air  force .

 4 )  Meanwhile ,  bombing  Assad  would  help  ISIS 

 Another  argument  you  hear  is  that ,  if  Obama  isn 't  going  to  bomb  ISIS  in  Syria ,  he  should  at  least  bomb  Syrian  regime  targets .  But ,  again ,  there  is  no  way  to  do  this  without  helping  ISIS ,  even  if  the  aim  would  be  to  help  Syrian  moderate  rebels .

 As  long  as  the  Syrian  civil  war  is  a  three -way  fight  between  two  American  enemies  ( Ass ad  and  ISIS )  plus  one  maybe -sort a -p ot ential  American  ally  that  is  nowhere  near  winning ,  the  US  is  just  very  unlikely  to  intervene"
