 What ,  then ,  is  the  evidence  that  Jesus  Christ  lived  in  this  world  as  a  man ?  The  authorities  relied  upon  to  prove  the  reality  of  Christ  are  the  four  G ospels  of  the  New  Testament — Matthew ,  Mark ,  Luke  and  John .  These  G ospels ,  and  these  alone ,  tell  the  story  of  his  life .  Now  we  know  absolutely  nothing  of  Matthew ,  Mark ,  Luke  and  John ,  apart  from  what  is  said  of  them  in  the  G ospels .  Moreover"

 To  estimate  this ,  we  can  use  the  numbers  that  Richards  provided  for  Romans  and  scale  them  up  based  on  the  size  of  the  G ospels . 
 
 Although  the  number  of  words  in  ancient  manuscripts  is  slightly  different  due  to  textual  variants ,  the  Greek  text  of  Romans  may  be  said  to  have  7 , 111  words ,  while  the  four  G ospels  have  these  figures :

 We  are  being  hit  by  a  double  wh ammy :  shrinking  budgets  and  organis ational  instability .  The  disruptions  feel  constant .  In  2013 ,  the  Health  and  Social  Care  Act  came  into  force  and  it  led  to  18  months  of  st asis .

 All  of  this  points  to  the  conclusion  that  when  Paul  coined  the  Greek  word  arsen oko it ai ,  he  was ,  quite  simply ,  referring  to  Lev itic us  18 : 22  and  20 : 13 ,  and  their  prohibition  of  men  having  sex  with  men ,  as  translated  in  the  Sept u ag int . 
 
 In  other  words ,  just  as  Lev itic us  is  not  talking  about  temple  prostitution ,  but  is  a  general  prohibition  of  men  having  sex  with  men ,  so  Paul  in  his  letters  is  upholding  a  general  prohibition  of  men  having  sex  with  men .

 And ,  now ,  let  us  consider  some  of  the  facts  connected  with  this  word  Ge hen na .  They  are  the  more  important  because  this  word  is  specially  relied  upon  as  teaching  the  doctrine  of  endless  tor ments ,  the  doctrine  of  hell ,  as  popular ly  believed .

 Many  other  such  stories  are  casually  repeated  today .  We  are  told  that  the  Church ,  in  the  18 th  century ,  led  campaigns  against  vaccination  for  small pox  on  the  grounds  that  vaccines  interfered  with  divine  prov idence .  Then ,  in  the  19 th  century ,  the  Church  was  supposed  to  have  objected  to  ana est hetics ,  especially  for  women  in  labor  since  the  p angs  of  childbirth  were  supposed  to  be  a  punishment  for  original  sin .

 These  certificates  were  real  indul g ences  that  anyone  could  obtain  which  abs olved  them  from  sin .  These  were  often  obtain able  for  a  specified  amounts  of  money .  According  to  Christ os  Y ann ar as ,  the  abs olution  granted  by  these  certificates  had  no  connection  with  any  participation  by  the  faithful  in  the  Mystery  of  Pen ance ,  nor  in  the  Mystery  of  the  E uch arist .[ 2 ]  These  indul g ences  began  to  be  used  among  Greeks  living  under  the  Turkish  y oke  and  were  widespread  in  the  six teenth  century .

 Finally ,  one  cannot  avoid  the  abuse  crisis .  This  was  the  worst  betrayal  of  local  Catholic  communities ,  who  gave  their  complete  trust  to  the  elites  of  the  Church .

 Do  ye  exercise  faith  in  the  redemption  of  him  who  created  you ?  Do  you  look  forward  with  an  eye  of  faith ,  and  view  this  mortal  body  raised  in  immortality ,  and  this  corruption  raised  in  incor ruption ,  to  stand  before  God  to  be  judged  according  to  the  deeds  which  have  been  done  in  the  mortal  body ?

How  then  should  the  dispens er  of  the  Divine  gifts  not  be  blessed ,  since  he  im itates  the  gifts  of  God  and  models  his  own  good  deeds  on  the  Divine  generosity ?

 As king  a  Christian  to  take  part  in  or  offic iate  ( you  can  bet  this  is  next )  a  same  sex  wedding ,  even  through  their  business ,  is  like  asking  a  Muslim  to  eat  a  pork  r ind . 
 
 Christ ians  see  marriage  as  a  sacrament .  A  same  sex  marriage  therefore  is  the  sac rem ant al ization  of  a  sin .  The  government  forcing  the  Faith ful  to  participate  in  sin  goes  well  beyond  serving  someone  a  meal .  There âĢ Ļ s  nothing  sinful  about  eating .

But  even  if  a  demographic  shift  seems  inevitable ,  the  question  is :  will  the  power  shift  be  inevitable ?

The  most  common  of  these  arguments  is  that  Smith  interpreted  the  documents  by  revelation ,  rather  than  a  standard  "" translation ""  of  text  from  one  language  to  another ,  in  a  process  similar  to  his  translation  of  the  Bible .[ 66 ][ 140 ]  In  2014 ,  the  LDS  Church  published  an  essay  on  its"

 Did  Jesus  Christ  Really  Live ?  ( ca .  1922 ) 
 
 Scient ific  inquiry  into  the  origins  of  Christianity  begins  today  with  the  question :  "" Did  Jesus  Christ  really  live ?""  Was  there  a  man  named  Jesus ,  who  was  called  the  Christ ,  living  in  Palestine  nineteen  centuries  ago ,  of  whose  life  and  teachings  we  have  a  correct  account  in  the  New  Testament ?

 Why  was  Paul  opposed  to  homosexuality ? 
 
 It  seems  clear  enough  that  Paul  condemned  homosexual  sex  in  general .  After  all ,  he  had  grown  up  a  Jew .  Even  after  he  became  a  Christian  he  was  still  steep ed  in  Jewish  scripture  and  law ,  as  seen  in  his  letters .  So  in  the  absence  of  any  statement  from  Jesus  Christ  on  the  subject ,  it  is  not  surprising  that  he  ad hered  to  Jewish  law  on  this  point .  In  fact ,  the  various  lists  of  sins  and  offenses  that  he"

The  ocean  ( He brew :  y am )  represents  the  fact  that  there  is  always  a  bigger  thought .  The  Hebrew  word  for  right  is  y ame en .

 Why  was  Paul  opposed  to  homosexuality ? 
 
 It  seems  clear  enough  that  Paul  condemned  homosexual  sex  in  general .  After  all ,  he  had  grown  up  a  Jew .  Even  after  he  became  a  Christian  he  was  still  steep ed  in  Jewish  scripture  and  law ,  as  seen  in  his  letters .  So  in  the  absence  of  any  statement  from  Jesus  Christ  on  the  subject ,  it  is  not  surprising  that  he  ad hered  to  Jewish  law  on  this  point .

 Instead ,  this  is  what  I  was  trying  to  get  at .  The  church  builds  temples .  It  does  so  because  of  a  belief  that  Jesus  commanded  it .  I  support  them  in  their  desire  to  follow  their  religious  conviction  to  build  temples .  Either  through  a  mistake  of  history  ( Sol omon ,  anyone ?)  or  because  Jesus  wants  it  this  way ,  however ,  the  temples  are  extremely  expensive .  Big  buildings  are  costly  anyway ,  but  these  temples  use  only  the  finest  of  materials ,  the  best  trades men ,  the  latest  design  techniques  for  energy  efficiency ,  and  the  most  advanced  architectural  practices  so  that"

 So  what âĢ Ļ s  going  on ?  At  least  three  factors ,  I âĢ Ļ d  suggest ,  need  to  be  considered .  First ,  or  so  the  argument  goes ,  neither  the  pope  nor  the  Holy  See  can  be  a  credible  medi ator  between  the  regime  and  the  opposition  if  it  is  seen  as  supporting  one  of  the  two  sides . 
 
 That âĢ Ļ s  a  reasonable  position .  But  there âĢ Ļ s  one  problem  with  this  argument .  Med i ators  surely  aren âĢ Ļ t  expected  to  stand  to  the  side  patiently  waiting  for  the  conversation  to  resume  while  one  party  to  the  discussion  beats  the  living  day lights  out  of"

 Given  the  fact  that  the  pope  is  not  protected  from  being  stupid ,  imp r ud ent ,  or  corrupt ,  and  that  he  teaches  with  varying  levels  of  authority ,  there  can  be  such  a  thing  as  legitimate  criticism  of  a  pope .  Any  criticism  would  have  to  come  from  a  spirit  of  great  humility  and  with  respect  to  any  authority  the  pope  exercises  on  a  particular  subject :  heresy  and  sch ism  are  not  a  part  of  legitimate  criticism .

 So  what âĢ Ļ s  going  on ?  At  least  three  factors ,  I âĢ Ļ d  suggest ,  need  to  be  considered .

Any  criticism  would  have  to  come  from  a  spirit  of  great  humility  and  with  respect  to  any  authority  the  pope  exercises  on  a  particular  subject :  heresy  and  sch ism  are  not  a  part  of  legitimate  criticism .
