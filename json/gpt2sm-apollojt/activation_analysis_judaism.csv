 Testing  is  a  Security  Concern 
 
 As  an  advocate  of  unit  testing ,  I  wonder  how  the  code  could  have  passed  a  unit  test  suite . 
 
 Unfortunately ,  the  test ability  of  the  problematic  source  code  is  very  poor .  In  the  current  code ,  functions  are  long ,  and  they  cover  many  cases  in  different  conditional  branches .  This  makes  it  hard  to  invoke  specific  behavior ,  and  bring  the  functions  in  a  state  in  which  the  given  behavior  can  be  tested .  Furthermore ,  observ ability  is  low ,  especially  since  parts  of  the  code  deliberately  obfusc ate  results  to  protect  against  certain  times  of  attacks .

( Actually ,  we  only  read  52  of  the  54  portions  on  Sh abb at :  The  first  portion  of  the  Torah ,  Bre ish is ,  is  always  read  on  the  Sh abb at  immediately  following  Sim chat  Torah .

 The  answer  is  that  we  do  not  derive  our  approach  toward  homosexuality  from  the  fact  that  the  Torah  made  it  a  capital  offense .  We  learn  it  from  the  fact  that  the  Bible  makes  a  moral  statement  about  homosexuality .  It  makes  no  statement  about  gathering  wood  on  the  Sabbath .  The  Torah  uses  its  strongest  term  of  cens ure  —  "" ab omination ""  —  to  describe  homosexuality .  It  is  the  Bible 's  moral  evaluation  of  homosexuality  that  distinguishes  homosexuality  from  other  offenses ,  capital  or  otherwise .  As  Professor  Greenberg ,  who  bet rays  no  inclination  toward  religious  belief  writes ,  "" When  the  word  to ev ah  ("" ab omination "")  does  appear  in  the  Hebrew  Bible"
