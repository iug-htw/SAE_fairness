 The  Culture  of  Stone hen ge

 What  they  found  was  evidence  of  a  civilization  transitioning  from  regional ism  to  a  more  integrated  culture .  Nevertheless ,  Britain 's  Stone  Age  people  were  isolated  from  the  rest  of  Europe  and  didn 't  interact  with  anyone  across  the  English  Channel ,  Parker  Pearson  said .

 These  days ,  Stone hen ge  is  nothing  if  not  the  center  of  speculation  and  mystery .  The  monument  has  inspired  its  fair  share  of  myths ,  including  that  the  wizard  Merlin  transported  the  stones  from  Ireland  and  that  UFOs  use  the  circle  as  a  landing  site .
