One  in  20  women  said  they  had  been  raped  since  they  were  16 .  One  in  200  said  they  had  been  raped  in  the  previous  12  months .  In  terms  of  the  population  of  England  and  Wales ,  that  suggests  85 , 000  women  are  raped  each  year  -  230  a  day .  And  yet  the  number  of  men  convicted  of  rape  is  fewer  than  800  a  year .  So  the  chance  of  a  victim  seeing  her  attacker  jailed  is  less  than  one  in  100 .
