 If  you âĢ Ļ ve  read  Ev olving  in  Monkey  Town  you  know  that  some  of  my  most  serious  doubts  about  Christianity  were  triggered  by  questions  related  to  religious  plural ism  and  the  destiny  of  the  un - ev angel ized .  After  witnessing  the  public  execution  of  a  Muslim  woman  from  Afghanistan  on  TV ,  I  began  struggling  with  the  idea  that  millions  upon  millions  of  people  like  Zar min a  had  been  sentenced  to  hell  for  eternity ,  most  without  ever  hearing  the  gospel .

 Rel ate :  I  think  the  people  who  decide  the  scheduling  over  at  The  One  Year  Bible  need  to  make  a  few  minor  adjustments .  I  really  like  being  able  to  read  through  scripture  in  the  format  and  fashion  they  have  set  it  up  and  each  day âĢ Ļ s  reading  seems  to  be  pretty  balanced  for  length .  It  is  just  that  today âĢ Ļ s  Old  Testament  reading  should  have  happened  two  days  ago .  They  got  their  days  wrong . 
 
 Speaking  of  getting  their  days  wrong ,  I  often  hear  around  this  time  of  year  that  Christians  shouldn âĢ Ļ t  celebrate  Christmas  because  it  is  really  the  pagan  holiday  Saturn alia .  Hog wash ."

Some  Gn ostic  documents  are  the  Gospel  of  Truth ,  the  Letter  to  R he gin us ,  Treat ise  on  the  Three  N atures ,  Apocalypse  of  Adam ,  the  Gospel  of  Matth ias ,  Gospel  of  Philip ,  Acts  of  Peter ,  and  Acts  of  Thomas .  Although  the  Gn ostics  were  prolific  writers ,  most  of  their  works  have  been  burnt  or  lost  in  favor  of  proto - orthodox  writings  ( and  known  only  through  pat rist ic  references ). 
 
 Some  scholars  have  theor ized  that  Gn ost icism  has  its  roots  in  pre - Christian  religions ,  instead  of  being  merely  an  off shoot  of  Christianity .

 A  religion  like  Christianity  has  a  particular  need  to  be  conservative  and  reject  new  ideas  since  they  already  have  the  perfect  plan  given  by  a  perfect  source . 
 
 On  the  other  hand ,  Christianity  in  many  ways  welcomes  change .  Many  Christians  feel  free  to  declare  other  church  leaders  or  traditions  to  be  here tical .  Christianity  is  the  opposite  of  conservative  when  you  consider  its  45 , 000  denominations ,  which  are  expected  to  grow  to  70 , 000  by  2050"

 First ,  it  would  mean  that  the  two - store y  version  of  Christianity  was  the  correct  version .  What  would  remain  if  all  those  artifacts  of  the  faith  were  removed  would  be  the  mere"

 The  first  book  I 've  read  about  Brother  Andrew  was  "" God 's  Call ',  which  as  the  book  j okingly  describes  as  God 's  Sm ugg ler  2 .  I  enjoyed  that  book  so  when  I  saw  this  on  christ ian audio ,  I  immediately  grabbed  it . 
 
 I  just  finished  listening  to  it  and  I 'm  blown  away  by  Brother  Andrew 's  story .  Somehow  I  could  relate  to  him  having  being  a  God - h ating  atheist  to  a  Christian .  It 's  amazing  how  God  works  in  people 's  lives . 
 
 The  narrator  for  this  audi obook  is  amazing"

 Here  are  some  questions  for  people  who  don 't  agree : 
 
 1 .  If  the  games  were  NOT  to  have  criticism  against  Jude o - Christian  faiths ,  why  research  in - depth  into  it ?  Obviously ,  the  developers  put  more  research  into  all  the  theology ,  and  they  don 't  ever  seem  to  portray  the  angels ,  Y H V H ,  or  any  other  Law - centered  character  as  benevolent  in  the  main  series ."

 What  would  be  the  meaning  of  the  Christian  gospel  if  there  were  no  wonder working  relics ,  no  true  Body  and  Blood  of  Christ ,  no  true  Bapt ism  in  the  death  and  resurrection  of  Christ ?  What  if  there  were  no  weeping  icons ? 
 
 First ,  it  would  mean  that  the  two - store y  version  of  Christianity  was  the  correct  version .  What  would  remain  if  all  those  artifacts  of  the  faith  were  removed  would  be  the  mere"

 Feel  pretty  nervous 
 
 Three  teams  have  win  probabilities  between  50  and  70  percent  this  week :  No .  4  Ole  Miss  ( host ing  No .  3  Auburn ),  No .  7  TCU  ( travel ing  to  No .  20  West  Virginia ),  and  No .  24  Duke  ( heading  to  Pittsburgh ).  All  three  have  games  they 'd  win  two  of  three  times ,  but  that  basically  means  if  they  roll  a  5  or  6  on  a  die ,  they  lose .  Those  aren 't  comfortable  odds ,  and  there 's  only  about  a  29  percent  chance  that  all  three  win .

 To  that  end ,  the  royal  couple  took s  steps  to  create  an  Inquisition ,  the  purpose  of  which  would  be  to  identify  false  converts  ( fake  convers os )  within  the  Spanish  Empire . 
 
 Initially ,  the  Pope  rejected  the  request .  But  after  the  King  and  Queen  threatened  to  withdraw  Spain 's  troops  from  defending  the  Vatican  and  leaving  Christianity  und ef ended  against  the  growing  threat  of  the  Muslim  Ottoman  Empire ,  the  Pope  c aved  and  issued  the  Ex ig it  S inc er as  Dev otion is  Affect us ,  through  which  the  Inquisition  was  established  in  the  Kingdom .
